  - Q-Sys version grabs the swapi.dev data upon initial load and then refreshes the data after displaying the previously uploaded data.  This is not ideal, however due to the event based packages in Q-Sys I left it as is since it technically "met" the requirements (although I see a deeper requirement being a translation of an API which this would failat).
  - As such, please considder the Q-Sys version a bonus :)
